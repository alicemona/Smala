Djnn is a c++ library dedicated to the programming of interactive software.
It is the result of the work from the Interactive Informatics team at ENAC http://lii.recherche.enac.fr

This library provides a new (and still incomplete) implementation of the djnn's model. A former implementation as well as information on the model can be found here: http://djnn.net

This library can be used through a dedicated language named Smala: http://smala.io
